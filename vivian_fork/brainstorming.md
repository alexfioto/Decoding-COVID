ideas:

* show an interactive graph of up to all 50 states which compare the rise in covid vs the calculated mask sentiment up to june 2020

* after june, plot a fitted curve vs estimated covid mask sentiment and the actual points




Implementations:

Plot the points on a plot, then plot on top various equations to fit ot the data

Run points through a log regression to fit a curve




flask deployment:

have a slider which changes mask sentiment past june 2020 to show changes in the curve

show the equation produced in latex
